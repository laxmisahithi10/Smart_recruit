Prompt for Smart Recruitment System (Recruiter Dashboard)

Build an AI-powered Smart Recruitment Dashboard for recruiters, integrating intelligent automation, bias detection, and data-driven insights — simplifying hiring decisions through a single unified dashboard.

🏠 Home / Dashboard Page

Clean, professional recruiter dashboard UI.

A floating AI Avatar Assistant (bottom-right corner) acts as an interactive HR chatbot.

Schedules interviews automatically by generating Google Meet/Zoom links.

Emails the meeting link and details to shortlisted candidates.

Can handle recruiter queries like:

“Schedule interviews for top 3 Java developers.”

“Show top performers based on last interview.”

Manages notifications, reminders, and interview timelines.

Provides voice + text chat interface for smooth interaction.

📊 Charts & Analytics (Agenda) Section

Central workspace where recruiters upload candidate data (CSV) exported from a shared Excel sheet filled by applicants.

The system performs AI-based analysis of candidates:

Parses and extracts candidate skills, experience, and education.

Displays data visualizations — skill radar charts, bar graphs, pie charts, etc.

Allows recruiters to compare multiple applicants visually.

Fairness & Bias Detection:

Analyzes uploaded Job Descriptions (JDs) and scoring patterns.

Detects potential bias indicators like:

“JD may discourage female applicants – uses ‘aggressive’ frequently.”

“Possible bias detected — candidate has same surname as recruiter.”

Displays a Fairness Score and suggests inclusive alternatives.

🎥 AI-Driven Interview Module

AI Avatar automates the entire interview process:

Creates and shares meeting links via email and calendar integration.
